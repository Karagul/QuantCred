CDS Pricing
===========

QuantCred provides functionality for pricing credit default swaps
(CDS's).

A CDS is a contract consisting of two parts ("legs"):

1. An annuity paid by the protection seller until the named creditor
   defaults. This is known as a "risky annuity".
2. A payment paid by the protection seller when the named creditor
   default.

Every CDS also has a maturity :math:`T`. Both legs of the CDS are
cancelled at this time. 

The value of a CDS is the difference between these two legs.

Payment until Default
---------------------

Suppose a continuous risky annuity is given at a rate of one unit of
currency per year. If :math:`Z(t)` is the discount curve related to that
currency and :math:`Q(t)` is the survival curve of the creditor, then
the value ("RPV01") of this risky annuity is given by

.. math:: \text{RPV01} = \int_{0}^{T} Q(t)Z(t) dt.

In QuantCred, this may be calculated with the `RPV01_continuous`
function::

    from math      import exp
    from quantcred import RPV01_continuous

    def expdecay(r, t):
        return exp(-r * t)
    Q = lambda t: expdecay(0.0050, t) # 50 bps hazard rate
    Z = lambda t: expdecay(1.5000, t) # 150 bps interest
    T = 1 # 1 year
    annuity = RPV01_continuous(Q, Z, T)
