QuantCred provides tools for pricing credit derivatives. But this
requires first having some metric of creditworthiness. 

One such metric is the **survival probability**, which is the
probability that a given creditor does not go into default up to
some time in the future. The function that maps time horizons to the
corresponding survival probabilities are called **survival curves**.

A survival curve $Q(t)$ should satisfy the following:

1. $Q(0)=1$, 
2. $Q'(t) < 0$.

When such conditions hold, one may define the **hazard rate curve**
$\lambda (t)$ with the equation

$$Q(t) = \exp \left( - \int_{0}^{t} \lambda (u) du \right).$$

Hazard rates are to survival curves as interest short rates are to
discount curves.

The pricing functionality provided in QuantCred requires inputing both
a survival curve $Q$ as well as a discount curve $Z$.
