Survival Curves
===============

The pricing of credit derivatives requires some metric for
creditworthiness. One such metric is the probability for which a
creditor remains solvent up to some time horizon.

This may be formalized as a **survival curve** :math:`Q`, a function
that maps time horizons :math:`t` to corresponding survival
probabilities :math:`Q(t)`.

Survival curves must satisfy two mathematical conditions:

1. :math:`Q(0) = 1`, and
2. :math:`Q(t) \geq 0`, and
3. :math:`Q'(t) \leq 0`.

It is then possible to derive a **hazard rate curve** :math:`\lambda`
defined by

.. math:: \lambda (t) = - \frac{Q'(t)}{Q(t)}.

Survival curves are analogous to discount curves. In the same way,
hazard rates are analogous to interest short rates.

In QuantCred, survival curves are given as functions. For example,
the following defines a survival curve `Q` with a constant hazard
rate of 0.0050/year (50 bps)::

  from math import exp

  def expdecay(r, t):
      return exp(-r * t)
  Q = lambda t: expdexay(0.005, t)

Most pricing functionality requires both a survival curve :math:`Q(t)`
and discount curve :math:`Z(t)` as input.
